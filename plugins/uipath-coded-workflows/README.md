## Example Workflow

A typical coded workflow development workflow:

1. **Resolve project** - Detect or create a UiPath coded automation project
2. **Discover patterns** - Read existing `.cs` files to learn project conventions
3. **Create files** - Add workflows, test cases, or helper classes using templates
4. **Update project.json** - Add dependencies, entry points, and file info as needed
5. **Validate** - Run the validation loop until all files compile cleanly
6. **Run** - Execute the workflow with `rpa-tool run-file`

## Project Structure

When you create a UiPath coded automation project, it generates:

```
ProjectName/
├── project.json              # Project configuration (dependencies, entry points)
├── project.uiproj            # Project descriptor (Name, ProjectType, MainFile)
├── Main.cs                   # Main entry point workflow
├── Main.cs.json              # Metadata for Main.cs
├── [OtherWorkflow].cs        # Additional workflow/test case files
├── [OtherWorkflow].cs.json   # Metadata for each workflow/test case
├── [HelperClass].cs          # Coded Source File (plain C#, no metadata)
├── .codedworkflows/          # Auto-generated connection factories
├── .objects/                 # Object Repository metadata
└── .settings/                # IDE design settings
```

## Requirements

- UiPath Studio 2025.x+
- .NET 8.0+
- `rpa-tool` CLI (bundled with UiPath Studio)
- Claude Code CLI

## Getting Started

1. **Open your project** in UiPath Studio or point to a project directory
2. **Invoke the skill** with `/uipath-coded-workflows:uipath-coded-workflows`
   - The assistant auto-detects your project via `rpa-tool list-instances`
3. **Describe what you need** - new workflow, test case, helper class, or edits
4. **Review generated code** - the assistant validates all files automatically
5. **Run your workflow** with the provided `rpa-tool run-file` command

## Common Issues

### "rpa-tool" not found

Ensure UiPath Studio is installed and `rpa-tool` is available in your PATH. It ships with UiPath Studio 2025.x+.

### Validation errors after file creation

The assistant runs an automatic validation loop (up to 5 retries). If errors persist:
- Check that required NuGet packages are listed in `project.json` `dependencies`
- Verify namespace matches the sanitized project name
- Ensure `using` statements match the packages available in the project

### Missing service properties (CS0103)

Each `CodedWorkflow` service (e.g., `excel`, `system`, `uiAutomation`) requires its corresponding NuGet package in `project.json`. See the Service-to-Package mapping in the skill documentation.

### Project detection fails

If `rpa-tool list-instances` returns an empty array, either:
- Open the project in UiPath Studio first, or
- Provide the project directory path explicitly

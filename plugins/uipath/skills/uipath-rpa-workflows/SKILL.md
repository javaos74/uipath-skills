# RPA Workflow Architect

Generate and edit RPA workflows using a **discovery-first approach** with **iterative error-driven refinement**. Always understand before acting, start simple, and validate continuously.

This skill uses `uipcli` CLI commands (via `Bash`) and Claude Code's built-in tools (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`) to interact with UiPath Studio Desktop projects and manage workflow files.

## Core Principles

1. **Activity Docs Are the Source of Truth** — Installed packages may ship structured documentation at `{projectRoot}/.local/docs/packages/{PackageId}/`. When present, these docs contain source-accurate properties, types, defaults, enum values, conditional property groups, and working XAML examples. They eliminate guesswork and are more reliable than examples or CLI-retrieved defaults. Always check for them first; everything else is a fallback.
2. **Know Before You Write** — Never generate XAML blind. Never try to guess properties, types, or configurations. Understand the project structure, what packages are installed, what expression language is used, and what patterns existing workflows follow. The deeper your understanding, the fewer validation cycles you'll need.
3. **Use What You Know, Skip What You Don't Need** — If you already know the package ID and activity class name, go directly to its doc file — don't enumerate all packages first. If activity docs give you a complete XAML example, don't also call `get-default-activity-xaml`. Be efficient: the discovery steps are a priority ladder, not a mandatory checklist.
4. **Start Minimal, Iterate to Correct** — Build one activity at a time. Write the smallest working XAML, validate with `uipcli rpa get-errors`, fix what breaks, repeat. Start with what you know works (default or example values, configurations). Complex workflows emerge from validated building blocks, not from generating everything at once.
5. **Validate After Every Change** — Never assume an edit succeeded. Always confirm with `uipcli rpa get-errors`. Static validation catches most problems; `run-file` catches the rest.
6. **Fix Errors by Category** — Triage errors in order: Package (missing dependencies) → Structure (invalid XML) → Type (wrong property types) → Activity Properties (misconfigured activity) → Logic (wrong behavior). Fixing in this order avoids cascading false errors.

---

## CLI Output Format

All `uipcli` commands support `--format <format>` (table, json, yaml, plain).

**Always use `--format json`** for commands whose output you need to parse or act on (e.g., `get-errors`, `find-activities`, `list-workflow-examples`, `is connections list`). JSON output is structured, unambiguous, and avoids table-formatting surprises.

Use the default (table) only when displaying results directly to the user for readability.

## Core Workflow: Classify Request

**Determine CREATE or EDIT before proceeding:**

| Request Type | Trigger Words | Action |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **CREATE** | "generate", "create", "make", "build", "new" | Start with Phase 0 -> Discovery -> Generate |
| **EDIT** | "update", "change", "fix", "modify", "add to" | Start with Phase 0 -> Discovery -> Edit |

If unclear which file to edit, **ask the user** rather than guessing.

---

## Phase 0: Environment Readiness

**Goal:** Ensure Studio Desktop is running, connected, and targeting the correct project before any other operations.

### Step 0.1: Establish Project Root

The `uipcli rpa` commands use `--project-dir` to target a specific project (defaults to current working directory). **If the current working directory is NOT the UiPath project root, all commands will fail or target the wrong project.**

```bash
# Check if project.json exists in the CWD
ls {cwd}/project.json
```

If the CWD is not the project root:
- Locate the project root by finding `project.json`: `Glob: pattern="**/project.json"`
- **Pass `--project-dir` explicitly** to every `uipcli rpa` command, or
- Ask the user where their project is located

Store the project root path and use it consistently as `{projectRoot}` throughout all subsequent operations.

### Step 0.2: Verify Studio is Running

```bash
uipcli rpa list-instances --format json
```

**If no instances are found or Studio is not running:**
```bash
uipcli rpa start-studio
```
If `start-studio` fails with a registry key error, pass `--studio-dir` explicitly pointing to the Studio installation directory.

**If Studio is running but the project is not open:**
```bash
uipcli rpa open-project --project-dir "{projectRoot}"
```

**If Studio IPC connection fails** (error messages about connection refused, timeout, or pipe not found):
1. Check if Studio Desktop is actually installed on the machine
2. Try `uipcli rpa start-studio` to launch a fresh instance
3. If Studio is running but IPC fails, the user may need to restart Studio
4. Inform the user and ask them to ensure Studio Desktop is open and responsive

### Step 0.3: Authentication (If Needed)

Some commands (IS connections, workflow examples, cloud features) require authentication:

```bash
uipcli login
```

If you encounter auth errors (401, 403, "not authenticated") during any phase, prompt the user to run `uipcli login` to authenticate against their UiPath Cloud tenant.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal:** Understand project context, leverage installed activity documentation, study existing patterns, identify reusable components, and discover activities before writing any XAML.

### Step 1.1: Project Structure

```
Glob: pattern="**/*.xaml" path="{projectRoot}"       → list all XAML workflow files
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/project.json"          → read the project definition
Bash: ls -la {projectRoot}                            → explore project root (if needed)
```

Analyze:
- Where should new workflows be placed? (folder conventions)
- What naming pattern is used? (match existing file names)
- What similar workflows already exist?
- Should I use VB or C# syntax? (check `expressionLanguage` in `project.json`, also check existing workflows and imports for `Microsoft.VisualBasic`)
- What packages are already installed? (check `dependencies` in `project.json` and namespaces in existing XAML files)
- Are there existing connections, credentials, or objects I can reuse?

### Step 1.2: Discover Activity Documentation (Primary Source)

**This is the most important discovery step.** Installed activity packages may ship structured markdown documentation at `{projectRoot}/.local/docs/packages/{PackageId}/`. These docs are generated from activity source code and contain everything needed to configure activities correctly on the first try: properties, types, defaults, enum values, conditional property groups, and working XAML examples.

**Availability:** Docs exist only for **installed packages** and typically only for **newer package versions**. When you're confident about which package you need:
- **Package not installed?** Install it first: `uipcli rpa install-or-update-packages --packages '[{"id":"UiPath.WebAPI.Activities"}]'` — this also syncs docs if the package ships them.
- **Package installed but no docs?** Update to the latest version: `uipcli rpa install-or-update-packages --packages '[{"id":"UiPath.WebAPI.Activities"}]'` (omit version to get latest) — newer releases are more likely to ship documentation.

Prioritize installing/updating packages early. It unlocks both activity docs and `get-default-activity-xaml` (which also requires the package to be installed).

#### Filesystem Structure (Deterministic)

The directory layout is fixed and predictable:

```
{projectRoot}/.local/docs/packages/
+-- {PackageId}/                           # e.g., UiPath.WebAPI.Activities
    +-- overview.md                        # Package summary + categorized activity index with descriptions and links to docs
    +-- activities/                        # One file per activity
    |   +-- {ActivitySimpleClassName}.md   # e.g., NetHttpRequest.md, DeserializeJson.md
    |   +-- ...
    +-- coded/                             # (Optional) Coded workflow API ref -- ignore for XAML workflows
```

- `{PackageId}` matches the NuGet package ID from `project.json` dependencies (e.g., `UiPath.WebAPI.Activities`)
- `{ActivitySimpleClassName}` is the short class name without namespace (e.g., `NetHttpRequest`, not `UiPath.Web.Activities.Http.NetHttpRequest`)

#### Activity Doc Template (All Files Follow This Structure)

Every `activities/{ActivityName}.md` follows a consistent template:

1. **Header** -- `# Display Name`, fully qualified class name in code span, one-line description
2. **Metadata** -- `**Package:**`, `**Category:**`, optionally `**Platform:**` (`Cross-platform` or `Windows`)
3. **`## Properties`** -- subsections:
   - **`### Input`** -- table: Name, Display Name, Kind (`InArgument`/`Property`), Type, Required, Default, Description
   - **`### Output`** -- table: Name, Display Name, Kind (`OutArgument`), Type, Description. May include output type property breakdowns
   - **`### {GroupName} (conditional)`** -- groups with a `Visible When` column showing which controlling property value makes each property appear. Critical for modes like authentication, request body type, retry policy, etc.
   - **`### Common`** / **`### Options`** -- ContinueOnError, Timeout, etc.
4. **`## Valid Configurations`** -- conditional modes, mutually exclusive groups, valid property combinations
5. **`## Enum Reference`** -- exhaustive valid values per enum-typed property
6. **`## XAML Examples`** -- **copy-paste ready** snippets with correct syntax and realistic configurations. Best starting point for new activities -- richer than `get-default-activity-xaml` output.
7. **`## Notes`** -- tips, caveats, migration guidance

The `overview.md` provides: package summary and categorized activity index table with links to per-activity docs.

#### Decision Table

The filesystem structure is deterministic -- use it to skip unnecessary enumeration steps.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **You know the package + activity name** | Go directly: `Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/.local/docs/packages/{PackageId}/activities/{ActivityName}.md"` |
| **You know the package, not the activity** | `Read` the `overview.md`, then read the identified activity doc. |
| **You don't know the package** | `Grep` across `.local/docs/packages/` for keywords. |
| **Docs exist but activity isn't documented** | Use other activity docs in the same package as structural reference, fall back to `get-default-activity-xaml`. |
| **No docs for the package** | **Update the package first** (`uipcli rpa install-or-update-packages`) -- this often adds docs. If still no docs, fall back to Steps 1.4-1.7. |
| **Package not installed** | **Install it first** (`uipcli rpa install-or-update-packages`) -- both docs and `get-default-activity-xaml` require it. After install, check for docs before proceeding to fallbacks. |
| **No `.local/docs/` directory at all** | Project may not support this feature yet. Use fallback flow starting at Step 1.3. |

### Step 1.3: Search Current Project

Search existing workflows in the project for reusable patterns and conventions.

```
Glob: pattern="**/*pattern*.xaml" path="{projectRoot}"     → find files matching a pattern
Grep: pattern="ActivityName|pattern" path="{projectRoot}"  → search XAML content for activities
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/ExistingWorkflow.xaml"      → read a relevant existing workflow
```

**Choose your depth based on project maturity:**
- **Mature project** (has existing workflows): Prioritize local patterns — they reflect the project's established conventions (namespace prefixes, variable naming, error handling style).
- **Greenfield project** (empty or near-empty): Skip this step — local search will yield nothing useful.

### Step 1.4: Discover Activities (When Needed)

Use `uipcli rpa find-activities` when you need to find which activity implements a user-described action, discover activities not covered by installed docs, or get the exact fully qualified class name, type ID, and `isDynamicActivity` flag.

```bash
uipcli rpa find-activities --query "send mail" --limit 10 --format json
```

**When to use this command:**
- You need to find the correct activities to use in a workflow, searching as you would do in a global search engine for activities
- You need activity details: fully qualified class name, type ID, description, configuration, whether it's dynamic, whether it's a trigger
- The user describes an action (e.g., "get weather") and you need to discover which activity implements it
- You want to discover new activities not necessarily installed in the project (results are global, not limited to installed packages)
- Activity docs don't exist for the target package, and you need to explore available activities

**How search works:**
- Works similarly to Studio's activity search bar
- Returns **global** results — not limited to packages currently installed in the project
- **If a useful activity is found in an uninstalled package, install it immediately** (see [Step 1.2 Availability](#step-12-discover-activity-documentation-primary-source)) — this unlocks both activity docs and `get-default-activity-xaml`
- Tags can be used alongside the query to narrow down results further

**Examples:**
```bash
# Find activities for sending email
uipcli rpa find-activities --query "send mail" --limit 5 --format json

# Find weather-related activities
uipcli rpa find-activities --query "get weather" --format json

# Find Excel read activities
uipcli rpa find-activities --query "read range" --limit 10 --format json
```

### Step 1.5: Disambiguate Service / Provider

This step requires `find-activities` results from Step 1.4.

When results contain multiple competing packages for the same capability (e.g., O365 vs Gmail vs SMTP for email), determine the correct one using these signals — **do not ask the user unless all signals are ambiguous:**

**Auto-select** (skip prompting) when **any** of these are true:
- The user specified the provider (e.g., "send email via O365", "use Gmail")
- Only one package matches the search
- The project already has one of the competing packages installed (`dependencies` in `project.json`)
- The project defines a connection matching one of the options
- The workflow already uses activities from one of the packages — stay consistent with what's there
- If packages are legacy/deprecated and it's clear which is the modern one

**Prompt only as a last resort** — when multiple viable options exist and none of the above signals apply:
1. Present the top 2–4 choices from the search results
2. Mark the recommended option with **(Recommended)** — prefer the most modern/full-featured option
3. Include a one-line difference for each (e.g., "requires Integration Service connection" vs "protocol-based, works on-premise")
4. Continue with **only** the chosen package

**Save the preference:** After resolving disambiguation (whether auto-selected or user-chosen), suggest saving the preference to `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` in the project folder so future sessions auto-select without re-prompting. For example: _"Want me to save this preference (e.g., 'Always use O365 for email activities') to CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md so it's remembered for future workflows?"_

### Step 1.6: Resolve Activity Properties (Fallback)

Use `uipcli rpa get-default-activity-xaml` to retrieve the activity's default XAML template. **Requires the package to be installed** (see [Step 1.2 Availability](#step-12-discover-activity-documentation-primary-source)). If activity docs exist with XAML examples, prefer those as your starting point -- they're richer than bare defaults.

The command handles both non-dynamic and dynamic activities.

#### For Non-Dynamic Activities

```bash
uipcli rpa get-default-activity-xaml --activity-class-name "UiPath.Core.Activities.WriteLine"
```

#### For Dynamic Activities

```bash
uipcli is connections list # Find relevant connection ID, if any
uipcli rpa get-default-activity-xaml --activity-type-id "178a864d-90fd-43d3-a305-249b07ac0127" --connection-id "{connectionId}"

# Or, if no relevant connection, pass an empty string
uipcli rpa get-default-activity-xaml --activity-type-id "178a864d-90fd-43d3-a305-249b07ac0127" --connection-id ""
```

**When to use this command:**
- Activity docs don't exist or don't cover this specific activity
- You need the exact bare-bones default XAML template for Studio compatibility
- You're working with dynamic activities that require runtime-resolved properties
- You need to verify the correct property names and default values when docs are ambiguous

**Key parameters:**
- `--activity-class-name`: For non-dynamic activities. Must be fully qualified (e.g., `UiPath.Core.Activities.WriteLine`)
- `--activity-type-id`: For dynamic activities. Use `uipcli rpa find-activities` to find the exact type ID
- `--connection-id`: Optional, only used for dynamic activities. Discover available connections using `uipcli is connections list [connector-key]`

**For JIT custom types**, read the schema file:

```
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/.project/JitCustomTypesSchema.json"
```

For more details, see **[jit-custom-types-schema.md](./references/jit-custom-types-schema.md)**

### Step 1.7: Search Examples Repository (Last Resort)

Use the examples repository as a **last resort** when activity docs, `find-activities`, and `get-default-activity-xaml` don't give you what you need — or when you need **full workflow composition patterns** showing how multiple activities work together end-to-end. Activity docs describe individual activities well, but the examples repository shows multi-step orchestration.

```bash
# Search by service tags (AND logic — all tags must match)
uipcli rpa list-workflow-examples --tags '["web"]' --limit 10 --format json

# Multiple tags narrow down results
uipcli rpa list-workflow-examples --tags '["jira", "confluence"]' --limit 10 --format json

# Use prefix to filter by category
uipcli rpa list-workflow-examples --tags '["gmail"]' --prefix "email-communication/" --limit 15 --format json

# Once you identify relevant examples, retrieve XAML content:
uipcli rpa get-workflow-example --key "email-communication/add-new-gmail-emails-to-keap-as-contacts.xaml"
```

**Tag Selection Guidelines:**
- Identify the services/integrations the user wants (e.g., "salesforce", "gmail", "jira", "web")
- Convert to lowercase tags: `["salesforce"]`, `["gmail"]`, `["jira", "confluence"]`
- Multiple tags use AND logic — all tags must match
- Common tags: `confluence`, `jira`, `salesforce`, `outlook`, `gmail`, `slack`, `excel`, `sharepoint`, `teams`, `dropbox`, `hubspot`, `zendesk`, `servicenow`

**When to use the examples repository:**
- Activity docs, `find-activities`, and `get-default-activity-xaml` didn't provide enough context
- You need end-to-end workflow patterns showing multiple activities composed together
- You need to understand service-specific integration patterns (e.g., OAuth flows, trigger setups)
- You're building a complex multi-activity workflow and want to see how others structured similar automations

**When studying repository examples from `uipcli rpa get-workflow-example`:**
- The command returns the full XAML content directly
- Parse the namespace declarations at the top to identify required packages
- Look for `<Variable>` elements to understand data structures
- Study `<Argument>` elements for input/output patterns
- Study `<Configuration>` and `<Connection>` sections for determining dynamic activity properties usage
- Examine activity configurations for proper property settings

### Step 1.8: Get Current Context (As Needed)

Before generating, understand reusable elements by combining multiple reads:

```
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/project.json"                → project definition (deps, expression language)
Glob: pattern="**/*" path="{projectRoot}/.objects/"         → explore object repository
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/.objects/.metadata"          → object repository metadata
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/Main.xaml"                   → existing workflow (variables, arguments, imports)
Glob: pattern="**/*" path="{projectRoot}/.settings/"        → settings profiles
Bash: uipcli is connections list --format json              → available Integration Service connections
Bash: uipcli is connectors list --format json               → available connectors
```

This surfaces variables, arguments, imports, expression language, available connections, and reusable project-level resources.

### Step 1.9: Discover Connector Capabilities (For IS/Connector Workflows)

When the workflow involves Integration Service connectors (e.g., Salesforce, Jira, ServiceNow), explore the connector's capabilities before writing XAML:

```bash
# What activities does this connector offer?
uipcli is activities list <connector-key> --format json

# What data objects/resources does it expose?
uipcli is resources list <connector-key> --format json

# What fields does a specific resource have? (essential for configuring dynamic activity properties)
uipcli is resources describe <connector-key> <object-name> --format json
```

**Check if a connection exists:**
```bash
uipcli is connections list <connector-key> --format json
```

**If no connection exists**, you have two options:
1. **Create one** (requires user interaction for OAuth): `uipcli is connections create <connector-key>`
2. **Use a placeholder** — insert the dynamic activity with an empty `connectionId` and inform the user they need to configure the connection in Studio

**Verify a connection is active:**
```bash
uipcli is connections ping <connection-id>
```

If the ping fails, offer to re-authenticate: `uipcli is connections edit <connection-id>`

---

## Phase 2: Generate or Edit

### Guidelines for both CREATE and EDIT:
Apply Core Principles: consult activity docs first, read relevant [reference files](./references/) for XAML structure and patterns, start minimal and iterate.

### For CREATE Requests

**Strategy:** Generate minimal working version, expect to iterate. Take it one activity at a time. Build incrementally and validate frequently.

Use the `Write` tool to create a new `.xaml` file with proper XAML boilerplate. Refer to [basics-and-rules.md](./references/basics-and-rules.md) for the complete XAML file anatomy template.

```
Write: file_path="{projectRoot}/Workflows/DescriptiveName.xaml"
       content=<full XAML content with proper headers, namespaces, and body>
```

**File path inference:**
- Use folder conventions from project structure exploration
- Create descriptive filename: `Workflows/[Category]/[DescriptiveName].xaml` or follow existing project patterns
- Ensure filename ends with `.xaml`

### For EDIT Requests

**Strategy:** Always read current content before editing.

```
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/WorkflowToEdit.xaml"              → understand current structure
Grep: pattern="section to modify" path="{projectRoot}/..."       → OR search for specific sections
```

Then use the `Edit` tool for targeted string replacement:

```
Edit: file_path="{projectRoot}/WorkflowToEdit.xaml"
      old_string=<exact text from file>
      new_string=<modified text>
```

**Critical:** `old_string` must match exactly what's in the file and be unique. Include surrounding context if needed to ensure uniqueness.

---

## Phase 3: Validate & Fix Loop

- This phase repeats until we obtain a 0-error state or errors cannot be resolved automatically.
- It is acceptable to defer some remaining configuration to the user. Just inform the user about any required manual updates they need to make after generation.
- If the required activity connection does not exist, reuse any available connection in the project as a placeholder
- If certain activity properties or arguments are unknown, provide default values (e.g., placeholders, default type values, or use `uipcli rpa get-default-activity-xaml`)

### Step 3.1: Check for Errors

```bash
# Check errors for a specific file (preferred — faster, especially in large projects):
uipcli rpa get-errors --file-path "Workflows/MyWorkflow.xaml" --format json

# Check errors for the entire project:
uipcli rpa get-errors --format json

# Use cached errors (skip re-validation — faster but may be stale):
uipcli rpa get-errors --file-path "Workflows/MyWorkflow.xaml" --skip-validation --format json
```

**Notes:** `--file-path` must be **relative to the project directory** (e.g., `"Workflows/SendEmail.xaml"`, not absolute). Always prefer `--file-path` for targeted checks (faster). Use `--skip-validation` only for quick cached-error checks. For slow projects, increase timeout: `uipcli rpa --timeout 600 get-errors --file-path "..."`.

### Step 3.2: Categorize and Fix

| Error Category | Indicators | Fix Strategy |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Package Errors** | Missing namespace, unknown activity type | `Read` project.json -> `Bash` `uipcli rpa install-or-update-packages` |
| **Structural Errors** | Invalid XML, missing required properties | `Read` file -> `Edit` the XAML |
| **Type Errors** | Incorrect property type, invalid value | `Read` JIT schema / `Grep` XAML -> `Edit` the XAML |
| **Activity Properties Errors** | Unknown dynamic properties, misconfigured activity | `Read` activity docs (`.local/docs/packages/`) for correct properties/types -> or `Bash` `uipcli rpa find-activities` -> `Bash` `uipcli rpa get-default-activity-xaml` -> `Edit` the XAML |
| **Logic Errors** | Business logic issues, wrong behavior | `Read` file -> `Edit` the XAML |

**Fix order:** Package -> Structure -> Type -> Dynamic Activity -> Logic

### Step 3.3: Package Error Resolution

```
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/project.json"     → check current dependencies

Bash: uipcli rpa install-or-update-packages --packages '[{"id": "UiPath.Excel.Activities"}]'
```

Omit `version` to automatically resolve the latest compatible version (preferred — gets newest docs and features). Only pin a specific version when you have a reason to (e.g., known compatibility constraint).

**If `install-or-update-packages` fails:**
- **Package not found**: Verify the exact package ID — check spelling, use `uipcli rpa find-activities` to discover the correct package name from an activity's assembly
- **Network/feed error**: The user may need to check their NuGet feed configuration in Studio settings

### Step 3.4: Resolving Dynamic Activity Custom Types

Dynamic activities (e.g., Integration Service connectors) retrieved via `uipcli rpa get-default-activity-xaml` (with `--activity-type-id`) may use **JIT-compiled custom types** for their input/output properties. After the activity is added to the workflow, when you need to discover the property names and CLR types of these custom entities (e.g., to populate an `Assign` activity targeting a custom type property, or to create a variable of a custom type), read the JIT custom types schema:

```
Read: file_path="{projectRoot}/.project/JitCustomTypesSchema.json"
```

### Step 3.5: Focus Activity for Debugging

When `get-errors` returns an error referencing a specific activity (by IdRef or DisplayName), use `focus-activity` to highlight it in the Studio designer. This helps the user see the problematic activity in context and verify fixes visually:

```bash
# Focus a specific activity by its IdRef (from the error output):
uipcli rpa focus-activity --activity-id "Assign_1"

# Focus all activities sequentially (useful for walkthrough):
uipcli rpa focus-activity
```

This is especially useful when:
- An error references an activity and you want the user to confirm the context
- You've made a fix and want to show the user which activity was modified
- The error is ambiguous and you need to verify which activity instance is affected

### Step 3.6: Iteration Loop

```
REPEAT:
  1. uipcli rpa get-errors --file-path "path/to/workflow.xaml" --format json
  2. IF 0 errors (or errors cannot be resolved automatically) -> EXIT to Phase 4
  3. Identify highest-priority error category
  4. Apply appropriate fix
  5. (Optional) Focus the fixed activity: uipcli rpa focus-activity --activity-id "..."
  6. GOTO 1

DO NOT stop until all activities are resolved (recognized).
DO NOT skip validation steps.
DO NOT assume edits worked without checking.
```

Expect multiple iteration cycles for complex workflows.

### Step 3.7: Smoke Test (Optional but Recommended)

**Important:** `get-errors` (Studio validation) and `run-file` (runtime compilation) use different validation paths. Some errors — such as invalid enum values on activity properties — pass Studio validation but fail at runtime. Always treat the smoke test as a critical validation step, not just an optional extra.

After reaching 0 errors, run the workflow to catch runtime errors (wrong credentials, missing files, invalid property values, logic bugs) that static validation cannot detect:

```bash
# Run with default arguments:
uipcli rpa run-file --file-path "Workflows/MyWorkflow.xaml" --format json

# Run with input arguments:
uipcli rpa run-file --file-path "Workflows/MyWorkflow.xaml" --input-arguments '{"recipientEmail": "test@example.com", "subject": "Test"}' --format json

# Run with verbose logging for debugging:
uipcli rpa run-file --file-path "Workflows/MyWorkflow.xaml" --log-level Verbose --format json
```

**When to run:**
- The workflow has no compilation errors but you want to verify runtime behavior
- The workflow involves file I/O, API calls, or data transformations that could fail at runtime
- The user specifically asks to test the workflow

**When NOT to run:**
- The workflow has side effects (sends emails, modifies databases, calls external APIs) — warn the user first
- The workflow requires interactive input (UI automation, attended triggers)
- Compilation errors still exist (fix those first)

If `run-file` reveals runtime errors, analyze the output and loop back to Step 3.2 to fix them.

---

## Phase 4: Response

**Provide comprehensive summary:**

1. **File path** of created/edited workflow (clickable reference)
2. **Brief description** of what the workflow does
3. **Key activities** and logic implemented
4. **Packages installed** (if any)
5. **Limitations** or notes for the user
6. **Suggested next steps** (testing, parameterization, etc.)
7. **Encourage user to review and customize further as needed** (e.g., fill in placeholders, set up connections etc.)

**Do NOT just say "workflow created"** - give user confidence the request was fully fulfilled.

---

## Creating New Projects

When the user needs a brand-new UiPath project (not just a new workflow in an existing project):

```bash
uipcli rpa new \
  --name "MyAutomation" \
  --location "/path/to/parent/directory" \
  --template-id "BlankTemplate" \
  --expression-language "VisualBasic" \
  --target-framework "Windows" \
  --description "Automates invoice processing" \
  --format json
```

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Options | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| `--name` | Any string | (required) | Project folder name |
| `--location` | Directory path | (current dir) | Parent directory where project folder is created |
| `--template-id` | `BlankTemplate`, `LibraryProcessTemplate`, `TestAutomationProjectTemplate` | `BlankTemplate` | Project template |
| `--expression-language` | `VisualBasic`, `CSharp` | (template default) | Expression syntax for XAML workflows |
| `--target-framework` | `Legacy`, `Windows`, `Portable` | (template default) | .NET target framework |
| `--description` | Any string | (none) | Project description in project.json |

**After creation:**
1. Open the project in Studio: `uipcli rpa open-project --project-dir "/path/to/MyAutomation"`
2. The project root is now `/path/to/parent/directory/MyAutomation/`
3. Proceed to Phase 1 (Discovery) using the new project root

**Note:** `uipcli rpa new` may return `success: false` but still create the project files (partial success). If it fails, check whether the project directory and `project.json` were created before retrying.

---

## CLI Error Recovery

When `uipcli` commands fail, diagnose by error category:

| Error Pattern | Cause | Recovery |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| `"connection refused"`, `"EPIPE"`, `"pipe not found"` | Studio IPC not available | Run `uipcli rpa start-studio`, then `uipcli rpa open-project --project-dir "..."` |
| `"timeout"`, `"ETIMEDOUT"` | Command took too long | Increase timeout: `uipcli rpa --timeout 600 <command>`, or use `--skip-validation` for `get-errors` |
| `"not authenticated"`, `401`, `403` | Auth required for cloud features | Run `uipcli login` and re-try |
| `"package not found"`, `"version not available"` | Wrong package ID or version | Verify package name via `uipcli rpa find-activities`; omit `version` to auto-resolve latest |
| `"project not found"`, `"no project open"` | Wrong project-dir or project not open | Verify `--project-dir` path, run `uipcli rpa open-project` |
| `"file not found"` in `get-errors` | Wrong `--file-path` (must be relative to project) | Use path relative to project root, not absolute |
| `"Studio is busy"`, `"operation in progress"` | Studio is processing a previous request | Wait a few seconds and retry the command |
| Any unrecognized error | Unknown | Check `--verbose` flag on parent: `uipcli rpa --verbose <command>` for debug details, inform the user |

**General strategy:** Do NOT retry the same failing command in a loop. Diagnose the root cause, apply the recovery action, then retry once. If it fails again, inform the user.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Never** (items not already covered by Core Principles):
- Generate large, complex workflows in one go — build incrementally
- Assume a create/edit succeeded without validating with `uipcli rpa get-errors`
- Stop the iteration loop before reaching 0 errors
- Edit or create XAML without reading the appropriate [reference files](./references/)
- Use a non-unique `old_string` for `Edit` that matches multiple locations
- Create non-XAML workflow files (this skill creates XAML only)
- Use incorrect/guessed keys with `uipcli rpa get-workflow-example` (always use keys from list results)
- Pass absolute paths to `--file-path` in `get-errors` (must be relative to project directory)
- Ask the user to choose a service provider without first checking project signals — auto-select when possible (Step 1.5)
- Retry failing CLI commands in a loop without diagnosing the root cause
- Skip Phase 0 (Studio readiness) — all subsequent phases depend on Studio IPC
- Use connector/dynamic activities without checking whether a connection exists (`uipcli is connections list`)

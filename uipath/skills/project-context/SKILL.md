# UiPath Project Context Generator

Discover and document a UiPath automation project's structure, conventions, and architecture. Generates context files consumed by Claude Code (`.claude/rules/project-context.md`) and UiPath Autopilot in Studio Desktop (`AGENTS.md`).

## When to Use This Skill

- A UiPath project exists (project.json with UiPath dependencies) and `.claude/rules/project-context.md` does not exist yet
- User asks to "generate project context", "analyze this project", "create AGENTS.md", or "regenerate context"
- User invokes `/uipath:project-context` manually to force regeneration

## Auto-Trigger Conditions

This skill auto-triggers when ALL of the following are true:
1. A `project.json` exists at or near the current working directory
2. That `project.json` contains UiPath dependencies (any key matching `UiPath.*` in the `dependencies` object)
3. The file `.claude/rules/project-context.md` does NOT exist relative to the project root

If `.claude/rules/project-context.md` already exists, do NOT auto-trigger. The user must explicitly invoke `/uipath:project-context` to regenerate.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Locate the Project

Resolve the project directory:
1. If the user provided an explicit path, use it
2. Try `uip rpa list-instances --format json` to find an open Studio Desktop project
3. Fall back to current working directory
4. Verify `project.json` exists at the resolved path
5. Confirm it contains UiPath dependencies before proceeding

### Phase 2: Discovery

Follow the discovery procedure in [references/discovery-guide.md](references/discovery-guide.md). Gather:

1. **Project identity** — name, description, type, target framework, expression language
2. **Dependencies** — all UiPath packages with versions, any third-party NuGet packages
3. **Project structure** — directory layout, file counts by type (.cs, .xaml)
4. **Entry points** — list of entry point workflows with their arguments (inputs/outputs)
5. **Code patterns** — namespace convention, base classes used, coding style
6. **Naming conventions** — file naming patterns, class naming, variable conventions
7. **Key workflows** — what each major workflow does (from file names, class names, comments)
8. **Shared resources** — helper classes, models, Object Repository, connections

### Phase 3: Generate Context

Using the template in [assets/context-template.md](assets/context-template.md), produce the context document:

- **Maximum 200 lines**
- Structured with clear sections
- Factual only — include only what was actually discovered, never assume
- Actionable — tells an AI assistant or developer what they need to know to work in this project
- Omit any section where no relevant data was found

### Phase 4: Write Output Files

**File 1: `.claude/rules/project-context.md`**
1. Create the `.claude/rules/` directory if it does not exist
2. Write the generated context document to `.claude/rules/project-context.md`
3. This file is fully owned by the skill — overwrite on regeneration
4. This file is auto-loaded by Claude Code as a project rule

**File 2: `AGENTS.md` at project root**
1. If `AGENTS.md` does NOT exist: write the full context document
2. If `AGENTS.md` ALREADY exists:
   a. Read the existing content
   b. Look for fenced markers `<!-- PROJECT-CONTEXT:START -->` and `<!-- PROJECT-CONTEXT:END -->`
   c. If markers exist: replace ONLY the content between them with the new context
   d. If markers do NOT exist: append the fenced block at the end of the file:
      ```
      <!-- PROJECT-CONTEXT:START -->
      [generated context]
      <!-- PROJECT-CONTEXT:END -->
      ```
   This preserves any user-written content in AGENTS.md

### Phase 5: Report

After writing files, inform the user:
1. Files created/updated (with absolute paths)
2. Brief summary of what was discovered (project type, file counts, key entry points)
3. Note that `.claude/rules/project-context.md` is auto-loaded by Claude Code in every conversation
4. Note that `AGENTS.md` is read by UiPath Autopilot in Studio Desktop
5. Suggest running `/uipath:project-context` again after significant project changes

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER fabricate project information.** Only include facts discovered by reading actual files. If something cannot be determined, omit it entirely.
2. **Keep output under 200 lines.** Prefer tables and lists over prose. Every line must earn its place.
3. **Preserve user content in AGENTS.md.** Always use the fenced marker pattern when AGENTS.md already exists. Never modify content outside the markers.
4. **Do not modify any project source files.** This skill only reads the project and writes context documentation files.
5. **Sample intelligently, do not read exhaustively.** For large projects, read a representative sample (up to 20 source files). Prioritize entry points, Main.cs/Main.xaml, and files from different directories.
6. **Handle both project types.** Support coded workflow projects (.cs files), RPA projects (.xaml files), and mixed projects containing both.
7. **Never leave placeholders in output.** Every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` from the template must be replaced with actual values or the section must be omitted.
8. **Identical content in both output files.** The context written to `.claude/rules/project-context.md` and `AGENTS.md` must be the same (except for AGENTS.md fencing markers when appending to an existing file).

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT read every file in a large project — sample up to 20 representative files
- Do NOT include raw file contents in the output — summarize and extract patterns
- Do NOT guess what workflows do if unclear — describe only what is observable
- Do NOT overwrite user content in AGENTS.md outside the fenced markers
- Do NOT trigger when `.claude/rules/project-context.md` already exists unless user explicitly requests regeneration
- Do NOT add commentary or recommendations — this is a factual context document, not a code review

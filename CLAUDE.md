## Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing:
- `SKILL.md` — YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) + markdown body with instructions
- `references/` — Domain documentation and guides
- `assets/` — Templates and resources (optional)
- `scripts/` — Automation scripts (optional)

## Core Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `uipath-coded-workflows` | Create, edit, build, and run C# coded automations |
| `uipath-rpa-workflows` | Generate and edit XAML RPA workflows |
| `uipath-flow` | Create and debug JSON-based Flow projects |
| `uipath-platform` | Authentication, Orchestrator, deployment, CLI tools, Integration Service |
| `uipath-servo` | Desktop and browser UI automation and testing |

## Community Skills

Skills in `skills-community/` are contributed by the UiPath community and reviewed by UiPath.

## Experimental Skills

Skills in `skills-experimental/` are under active development. **Always confirm with the user before using.**

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `uipath-coded-agents` | Scaffold, build, run, evaluate, deploy, and sync UiPath coded agents |

## Multi-Tool Support

This repository is configured for three AI coding tools:

- **Claude Code** — Plugin via `.claude-plugin/`, skills at `skills/`
- **OpenAI Codex CLI** — `AGENTS.md` (symlink to this file), skills via `.agents/skills/` (symlink to `skills/`)
- **Cursor IDE** — Project rules in `.cursor/rules/`

### Symlinks

This repo uses git symlinks for cross-tool compatibility:
- `AGENTS.md` → `CLAUDE.md` (Codex CLI reads AGENTS.md)
- `.agents/skills/` → `skills/` (Codex CLI skill discovery)

On Windows, ensure `core.symlinks=true` in git config, or clone with `git clone -c core.symlinks=true`.

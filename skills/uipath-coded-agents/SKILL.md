# UiPath Coded Agents

## CLI Setup (run once at start)

Before running any `uip codedagents` commands, ensure the environment is ready:

```bash
# 1. Check uip is installed
which uip > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "uip found" || echo "uip NOT found — run: npm install -g @uipath/cli"

# 2. Activate the virtual environment (required if .venv exists)
if [ -d ".venv" ]; then source .venv/bin/activate; fi

# 3. Set up the Python environment (detects Python, installs uipath package if needed)
uip codedagents setup --output json
```

**Steps 2 and 3 are required.** Common errors if skipped:
- `"uipath executable not found"` → run `uip codedagents setup` first
- `"Found .venv but no virtual environment is activated"` → run `source .venv/bin/activate` before setup

Run these once per project environment. After setup succeeds, all `uip codedagents` commands will work.

If `uip` is not found, install it with `npm install -g @uipath/cli`. If `npm` is missing, ask the user to install Node.js first. All commands in this skill use `uip codedagents <cmd>` — do **not** substitute with `uv run uipath`.

**Do NOT add `--output json` to `uip codedagents` commands.** The `--output` flag is only valid for native `uip` commands (like `uip login`, `uip codedagents setup`). Commands forwarded to the Python CLI (`uip codedagents new`, `init`, `run`, `eval`, `deploy`, `push`, `pull`, `pack`, `publish`, `invoke`) do **not** accept `--output json` and will error.

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER add a `[build-system]` section to `pyproject.toml`**. No `hatchling`, no `setuptools`, no build backend. UiPath agents do not use a build system. Only include `[project]`, `[dependency-groups]`, and `[tool.*]` sections.
- **Always create a smoke evaluation set.** Every agent must include `evaluations/eval-sets/smoke-test.json` with 2-3 basic test cases. Create it in the Evaluate step, not during Build.
- **Select a framework before writing any code.** If the prompt clearly implies a framework (e.g., mentions tools, RAG, multi-step orchestration, or a specific SDK), pick the best match. If the prompt is ambiguous, ask the user to choose from: Simple Function, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or OpenAI Agents.
- **Correct SDK import: `from uipath.platform import UiPath`** — not `from uipath import UiPath` (that path does not exist and will cause `ImportError`). Always instantiate `UiPath()` inside functions/nodes, never at module level.
- **NEVER run `uip login` without `--tenant`.** The interactive tenant picker does not work from Claude's Bash tool. Always ask the user for environment, organization, and tenant name first, then run `uip login --output json` then `uip login tenant set "<TENANT>" --output json`.
- **Skip auth if already authenticated.** Before asking for credentials, check if `.env` contains `UIPATH_URL` and `UIPATH_ACCESS_TOKEN` (or run `uip login status --output json` if available). If auth is already configured, skip the Auth step entirely and continue the flow.
- **Auth MUST be an interactive question (when needed).** If auth is NOT configured, your ENTIRE response must be a single direct question. Do NOT wrap it in bullet points, "Next Steps" headers, or status summaries. Just ask and stop:

  > What is your UiPath **environment** (cloud/staging/alpha), **organization name**, and **tenant name**?

## Lifecycle Stages

Each stage has a reference file with detailed instructions. Read **only** the relevant reference when you reach that stage — do not preload.

| Stage | Reference | CLI Commands |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Auth** | [references/lifecycle/authentication.md](references/lifecycle/authentication.md) | `uip login` |
| **Setup** | [references/lifecycle/setup.md](references/lifecycle/setup.md) | `uip codedagents new <name>`, `uv sync`, `uip codedagents init` |
| **Build** | [references/lifecycle/build.md](references/lifecycle/build.md) | Code agent logic with framework patterns |
| **Bindings** | [references/lifecycle/bindings-reference.md](references/lifecycle/bindings-reference.md) | Sync resource overrides in `bindings.json` |
| **Run** | [references/lifecycle/running-agents.md](references/lifecycle/running-agents.md) | `uip codedagents run` |
| **Evaluate** | [references/lifecycle/evaluate.md](references/lifecycle/evaluate.md) | `uip codedagents eval` |
| **Deploy** | [references/lifecycle/deployment.md](references/lifecycle/deployment.md) | `uip codedagents deploy`, `uip codedagents invoke` |
| **Sync** | [references/lifecycle/file-sync.md](references/lifecycle/file-sync.md) | `uip codedagents push`, `uip codedagents pull` |

## One-Prompt Flow

When the user asks to create and deploy an agent end-to-end, follow these steps in order. Skip stages that are already done.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT stop between steps to ask "would you like me to continue?" or list next steps. Execute the entire flow automatically. Only pause when you genuinely need information from the user (auth credentials, project ID). After getting that info, resume immediately.**

1. **Framework** — Select framework from prompt context or ask user (see below). This MUST happen before setup because `uip codedagents new` scaffolds based on which framework package is installed.
2. **Setup** — Scaffold project: add framework dependency (`uv add uipath-langchain` etc.), `uv sync`, `uip codedagents new <project-name>`, then run `uip codedagents init`. Infer the project name from the user's prompt or the current directory name. **Do NOT authenticate yet** — auth happens after build.
3. **Build** — Implement agent logic using the selected framework's patterns. **CRITICAL: Always use lazy LLM initialization.** Never instantiate `UiPathAzureChatOpenAI`, `UiPathChat`, `UiPathChatOpenAI`, or any LLM client at module level — `uip codedagents init` imports the file and module-level LLM clients will fail because auth hasn't happened yet. Always create LLM instances inside functions/nodes. After implementing, re-run `uip codedagents init` to update schemas from the actual code.
4. **Bindings** — If the agent uses any UiPath platform resources (assets, queues, connections, processes, buckets, context grounding indexes, Action Center apps, or MCP servers), sync `bindings.json` with the code using [references/lifecycle/bindings-reference.md](references/lifecycle/bindings-reference.md). This ensures resource overrides work correctly when deployed to Orchestrator. Skip this step if the agent does not call any bindable SDK methods.
5. **Auth** — First check if `.env` already has `UIPATH_URL` and auth tokens. If yes, skip this step. If not, ask the user for credentials — output ONLY this question as your entire response:

> What is your UiPath **environment** (cloud/staging/alpha), **organization name**, and **tenant name**?

Then STOP and wait for the user to reply. After they reply, run `uip login --output json followed by uip login tenant set "<TENANT>" --output json` and continue the flow. Never run `uip login` without `--tenant`.
6. **Run** — Test locally with `uip codedagents run <ENTRYPOINT> '<input>'` (use the entrypoint name from `entry-points.json`, e.g., `main`).
7. **Push** — Tell the user to navigate to `{UIPATH_URL with the tenant segment removed}/studio_/projects` (Studio Web is an organization-level service, so the URL should only include the organization, e.g. `https://alpha.uipath.com/OrgName/studio_/projects`), create a new **Coded Agent** project, and paste the project ID. Add `UIPATH_PROJECT_ID=<id>` to `.env`, then run `uip codedagents push`. Required before evals. *(This step requires user input — wait for the project ID, then resume immediately.)*
8. **Evaluate** — Create **both** the evaluator config and the eval set, then run evals.

   **First**, create `evaluations/evaluators/llm-judge-trajectory.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "id": "LLMJudgeTrajectoryEvaluator",
     "evaluatorTypeId": "uipath-llm-judge-trajectory-similarity",
     "evaluatorConfig": {
       "name": "LLMJudgeTrajectoryEvaluator",
       "defaultEvaluationCriteria": {
         "expectedAgentBehavior": "Agent should process the input and return a response."
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Then**, create `evaluations/eval-sets/smoke-test.json` with 2-3 test cases based on the agent's input schema (version is string `"1.0"`, top-level `id`/`name` required, test cases in `evaluations` array):
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "id": "smoke-test",
     "name": "Smoke Test",
     "evaluatorRefs": ["LLMJudgeTrajectoryEvaluator"],
     "evaluations": [
       {
         "id": "test-1",
         "name": "Basic test",
         "inputs": {"field": "value"},
         "evaluationCriterias": {
           "LLMJudgeTrajectoryEvaluator": {
             "expectedAgentBehavior": "Agent should process the input and return a response."
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Finally**, run `uip codedagents eval <ENTRYPOINT> evaluations/eval-sets/smoke-test.json` (use the entrypoint name from `entry-points.json`).
9. **Deploy** — Run `uip codedagents deploy --my-workspace`. Do NOT ask the user which feed to use — default to `--my-workspace` and inform them: "Deploying to your personal workspace." If re-deploying, bump the patch version in `pyproject.toml` first.

Read the relevant reference file at each step — do not guess.

## Framework Selection

Infer the framework from the user's prompt when possible. If ambiguous, ask them to choose:

1. **Simple Function** — Plain Python with `Input`/`Output` models. No LLM. Best for deterministic logic.
2. **LangGraph** — StateGraph with conditional routing, tool use, interrupts. Best for complex LLM agents.
3. **LlamaIndex** — Workflow with events and RAG support. Best for knowledge retrieval.
4. **OpenAI Agents** — Lightweight agent with tools and handoffs. Best for simple LLM agents.

**Inference hints:** mentions of tools/tool calling, multi-step, or orchestration → LangGraph. RAG or knowledge retrieval → LlamaIndex. Simple handoffs or lightweight LLM → OpenAI Agents. No LLM needed → Simple Function. When in doubt, ask.

**Always tell the user which framework you selected and why** before proceeding to build. Example: "I'll use **LangGraph** for this agent since it involves tool calling and multi-step orchestration."

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Project authors cannot be empty` | Missing `authors` in `pyproject.toml` | Add `authors = [{ name = "Your Name" }]` to `[project]` section |
| `Version already exists` on deploy | Same version already published | Bump patch version in `pyproject.toml` before re-deploying |
| `Your local version is behind...Aborted!` | Push needs interactive confirmation | Use `uip codedagents push --overwrite` to force push |

# Orchestrator

Web application that manages automation resources, robots, processes, and execution. Central hub for attended and unattended automation orchestration.

Orchestrator serves as the backbone for:
- **Deployment** — publishing automation packages and managing versions
- **Execution** — starting, stopping, and monitoring automation jobs
- **Configuration** — managing assets, queues, and environment settings
- **Scheduling** — defining triggers and schedules for unattended execution
- **Monitoring** — tracking job status, execution logs, and system health

## Organization Model

```
Organization (cloud.uipath.com)
  └── Tenant                        ← Isolated environment (dev, staging, prod)
        └── Folder                  ← Logical container for resources
              ├── Processes         ← Published .nupkg automation packages
              ├── Jobs              ← Running or completed executions
              ├── Assets            ← Key-value configuration store
              ├── Queues            ← Distributed work item queues
              ├── Triggers          ← Event/queue-based job triggers
              ├── Schedules         ← Cron-based job scheduling
              ├── Storage Buckets   ← File storage for automation data
              ├── Machines          ← Robot execution environments
              └── Robots            ← Attended/Unattended agents
```

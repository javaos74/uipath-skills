# Generic Investigation Guide

Always apply these rules. If a product-specific `investigation_guide.md` exists, apply it **in addition** to these.

## Data Correlation

Before using any fetched data, verify it matches the user's reported problem:

- **Timestamp** — data falls within the time window the user described (or is recent enough to be relevant if no time was specified)
- **Entity identity** — the entity in the data (job, queue item, process, asset, etc.) is the one the user asked about, not a different one with a similar name
- **Environment** — data comes from the correct tenant, folder, or environment the user is working in
- **Causal relevance** — the data is about the problem itself, not about a side effect or unrelated event that happened around the same time

If the data doesn't match: **discard it**. Do NOT use unrelated data as a proxy. Report the mismatch and ask for clarification.

## Testing Prerequisites

Gather and verify these before drawing conclusions on any hypothesis:

1. **Reproduce the scope** — confirm you're looking at the same entity, environment, and time window the user reported
2. **Execution path** — trace what actually happened step by step (don't infer from final status alone)
3. **Error message** — read the full error, not just the type; details in the message often point to the root cause
4. **Configuration state** — check relevant settings/configuration at the time of failure; don't assume defaults
5. **Recent changes** — ask whether anything changed recently (deployments, config updates, infrastructure) that correlates with when the issue started
6. **Dependencies** — check upstream and downstream systems; a failure in one layer often manifests as symptoms in another

## Scope Boundary — Internal Platform Issues

This diagnostic tool operates from the **client perspective**. Do NOT attempt to investigate internal platform issues (implementation bugs, server-side defects, infrastructure internals). You have no visibility into them and testing hypotheses about them wastes the user's time.

- If evidence points to a **known limitation or platform bug**: present it to the user as a known issue, link to documentation if available, and suggest workarounds or contacting UiPath support
- If evidence rules out all client-side causes and the remaining explanation is an internal platform issue: **stop testing** and tell the user the problem appears to be on the platform side, recommend they open a support ticket with the evidence gathered so far
- Do NOT fabricate hypotheses about internal platform behavior you cannot observe or verify
- Do NOT ask the user to investigate server logs, database state, or infrastructure they don't control

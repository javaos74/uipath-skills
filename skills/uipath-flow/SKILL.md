# UiPath Flow Authoring Assistant

Comprehensive guide for creating, editing, validating, and debugging UiPath Flow projects using the `uip` CLI and `.flow` file format.

## When to Use This Skill

- User wants to **create a new Flow project** with `uip flow init`
- User is **editing a `.flow` file** — adding nodes, edges, or logic
- User wants to **explore available node types** via the registry
- User wants to **validate** a Flow file locally
- User wants to **debug** a Flow (cloud)
- User asks about the **`.flow` JSON format**, nodes, edges, definitions, or ports
- User asks **how to implement logic** in a Flow (scripts, HTTP calls, branching, etc.)

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS query the registry before building.** Run `uip flow registry pull` then `uip flow registry get <nodeType> --format json` for every node type you plan to use. Copy the `Data.Node` object into `definitions` verbatim — do not guess node schemas, port names, or input fields from memory.
2. **ALWAYS discover connector capabilities via IS before planning.** For every connector node, run `uip is activities list <connector-key>` and `uip is resources describe <connector-key> <resource>` to learn the exact operations, required fields, and field types. Without this, `inputs.detail` will be wrong and `$vars` references will be unresolvable — errors that `flow validate` does not catch.
3. **ALWAYS check for existing connections** before using a connector node. Run `uip is connections list <connector-key>` — if no connection exists, tell the user before proceeding.
4. **ALWAYS use `--format json`** on all `uip` commands when parsing output programmatically.
5. **Edit `flow_files/*.flow` only** — `content/*.bpmn` is auto-generated and will be overwritten.
6. **`targetPort` is required on every edge** — `validate` rejects edges without it.
7. **Every node type needs a `definitions` entry** — copy from `uip flow registry get <nodeType>` output. Never hand-write definitions.
8. **Script nodes must `return` an object** — `return { key: value }`, not a bare scalar.
9. **Do NOT run `flow debug` without explicit user consent** — debug executes the flow for real (sends emails, posts messages, calls APIs).
10. **Validate after every change** — run `uip flow validate` after each edit to the `.flow` file. Do not batch multiple edits before validating.

## Quick Start

These steps are for **creating a new flow from scratch**. For existing projects, skip to the relevant step. For small targeted edits (changing a script body, renaming a node, tweaking a port), skip straight to Step 6.

### Step 0 — Resolve the `uip` binary

The `uip` CLI is installed via npm. If `uip` is not on PATH (common in nvm environments), resolve it first:

```bash
UIP=$(command -v uip 2>/dev/null || npm root -g 2>/dev/null | sed 's|/node_modules$||')/bin/uip
$UIP --version
```

Use `$UIP` in place of `uip` for all subsequent commands if the plain `uip` command isn't found.

### Step 1 — Check login status

`uip flow debug` and process operations require authentication. `uip flow init`, `validate`, and `registry` commands work without login.

```bash
uip login status --format json
```

If not logged in and you need cloud features:
```bash
uip login                                          # interactive OAuth (opens browser)
uip login --authority https://alpha.uipath.com     # non-production environments
```

### Step 2 — Create a new Flow project

```bash
uip flow init <ProjectName>
```

This scaffolds a complete project. See [references/flow-file-format.md](references/flow-file-format.md) for the full project structure.

### Step 3 — Discover available node types

Before editing the `.flow` file, check what nodes are available:

```bash
uip flow registry pull                          # refresh local cache (expires after 30 min)
uip flow registry list --format json            # list all cached node types
uip flow registry search <keyword>              # search by name, tag, or category
uip flow registry search --filter "category=agent"
uip flow registry get <nodeType> --format json  # full schema for one node type
```

> **Auth note**: Without `uip login`, registry shows OOTB nodes only. After login, tenant-specific connector nodes are also available.

### Step 4 — Discover connector capabilities (when using connectors)

**Skip this step if the flow only uses OOTB nodes (scripts, HTTP, branching).** When the flow uses Integration Service connectors (e.g., Slack, Salesforce, Outlook), you **must** discover what the connector can do before planning. The flow registry tells you *which* connector nodes exist, but not what operations they support or what fields are required. Without IS discovery, generated flows will have missing or incorrect `inputs.detail`, empty `outputs` blocks, and unresolvable `$vars` references — issues that `flow validate` does not catch.

**Use the [/uipath:uipath-platform](/uipath:uipath-platform) skill for all IS operations.** It has the complete Integration Service reference including the agent workflow (connector → connection → ping → discover → resolve references → execute), field metadata, error recovery, and connection management. The key commands you'll need:

- `uip is activities list <connector-key>` — what operations the connector supports
- `uip is resources list/describe <connector-key>` — what data objects and fields are available
- `uip is connections list/ping/create <connector-key>` — check or create authenticated connections

Gather this information **before** moving to the planning step. For each connector node in the flow, you should know: which operation to use, what fields are required, and whether a connection exists.

### Step 5 — Plan the flow (interactive)

**Required when creating a new flow or adding multiple nodes.** Only skip this step for small targeted edits to an *existing* flow (e.g., changing a script body, renaming a node, tweaking one connection). When in doubt, plan.

**Before planning, read [references/flow-planning-guide.md](references/flow-planning-guide.md)** for the complete node catalog, node selection heuristics (when to use Decision vs Switch, Loop vs ForEach, connector vs HTTP, End vs Terminate), expression/variable syntax, wiring rules, and common flow patterns.

Generate a plan as a **self-contained HTML file** with a mermaid diagram and structured details. This lets the user (and PMs) visually review the flow topology before any code is written.

#### 5a. Write the plan file

Read [references/plan-template.html](references/plan-template.html) **once** and write `flow-plan.html` in the project directory by **copying the template and replacing the `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers** with actual content. Do not rewrite the HTML from scratch — preserve the Tailwind config, styles, and structure exactly. The HTML comment examples in the template show the expected format for each section.

> **Token efficiency:** Only read the template when generating a new plan. For subsequent updates (Step 5c), edit `flow-plan.html` directly — do not re-read the template.

The plan must include:

1. **Summary** — 2-3 sentences describing what the flow does end-to-end
2. **Mermaid diagram** — visual flowchart showing all nodes, edges, and branching logic. Use `subgraph` blocks to group related sections (e.g., "Data Ingestion", "Processing", "Notification"). For flows with 20+ nodes, subgraphs are essential for readability.
3. **Node table** — every node with: ID, display name, node type, and what it does
4. **Connector details** — for each connector node: connector key, operation, required input fields (from Step 4 IS discovery), and connection status (found/missing)
5. **Inputs & Outputs** — what the flow needs to start and what it produces
6. **Open questions** — anything the user hasn't specified, marked as `[REQUIRED: ...]`

#### 5b. Open the plan for review

```bash
open flow-plan.html    # macOS — opens in default browser
```

In chat, output a **short summary only** (goal + key nodes + any open questions). Tell the user to review the full plan and diagram in the browser.

#### 5c. Iterate until approved

**Do NOT proceed to Step 6 until the user explicitly approves the plan.** The iteration loop:

1. User reviews the plan in browser and gives feedback in chat (e.g., "move the Slack notification before the filter", "add an error handler after the API call", "use Salesforce instead of HubSpot")
2. Update `flow-plan.html` with the changes
3. Tell the user to refresh the browser page
4. Summarize what changed in chat
5. Repeat until the user says the plan is approved

### Step 6 — Build the flow

Edit `flow_files/<ProjectName>.flow` only. Never edit `content/<ProjectName>.bpmn` — it is auto-generated.

Build the flow by editing the `.flow` JSON directly. For each node:
1. Get the full node schema: `uip flow registry get <nodeType> --format json`
2. Copy the `Data.Node` object into the `definitions` array
3. Add the node instance to the `nodes` array with correct inputs (use field info from Step 4 IS discovery)
4. Add edges to the `edges` array with correct `sourcePort` and `targetPort`

See [references/flow-file-format.md](references/flow-file-format.md) for the full JSON schema, node/edge structure, and definition requirements.

### Step 7 — Validate loop

Run validation and fix errors iteratively until the flow is clean.

```bash
uip flow validate flow_files/<ProjectName>.flow --format json
```

**Validation loop:**
1. Run `uip flow validate`
2. If valid → done, move to Step 8
3. If errors → read the error messages, fix the `.flow` file
4. Go to 1

Common error categories:
- **Missing targetPort** — every edge needs a `targetPort` string
- **Missing definition** — every `type:typeVersion` in nodes needs a matching `definitions` entry
- **Invalid node/edge references** — `sourceNodeId`/`targetNodeId` must reference existing node `id`s
- **Duplicate IDs** — node and edge `id`s must be unique

### Step 8 — Debug (cloud) — only when explicitly requested

```bash
uip flow debug flow_files/<ProjectName>.flow
```

Requires `uip login`. Uploads to Studio Web, triggers a debug session in Orchestrator, and streams results. Always `validate` first — debug is a cloud round-trip with real side effects (see Critical Rule #9).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never guess node schemas** — always `uip flow registry get` first. Guessed port names or input fields cause silent wiring failures.
- **Never skip IS discovery for connector nodes** — the registry tells you a node exists; only IS tells you what operations and fields it supports. Skipping this is the #1 cause of broken connector nodes.
- **Never edit `content/*.bpmn`** — it is auto-generated from the `.flow` file and will be overwritten.
- **Never run `flow debug` as a validation step** — debug executes the flow with real side effects. Use `flow validate` for checking correctness.
- **Never skip the planning step for multi-node flows** — jumping straight to building produces flows that need major rework.
- **Never chain skills automatically** — if the flow needs an RPA process, coded workflow, or agent, insert a `core.logic.mock` placeholder and tell the user which skill to use. Do not invoke other skills.
- **Never hand-write `definitions` entries** — always copy from registry output. Hand-written definitions have wrong port schemas and cause validation failures.
- **Never batch multiple edits before validating** — validate after each change to catch errors early.

## Key Concepts

### validate vs debug

| Command | What it does | Auth needed |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `uip flow validate` | Local JSON schema + cross-reference check | No |
| `uip flow debug` | Converts to BPMN, uploads to Studio Web, runs in Orchestrator, streams results | Yes |

Always `validate` locally before `debug`. Validation is instant; debug is a cloud round-trip.

### CLI output format

All `uip` commands return structured JSON:
```json
{ "Result": "Success", "Code": "FlowValidate", "Data": { ... } }
{ "Result": "Failure", "Message": "...", "Instructions": "Found N error(s): ..." }
```

Always use `--format json` for programmatic use. The `--localstorage-file` warning in some environments is benign.

## Completion Output

When you finish building or editing a flow, report to the user:

1. **File path** of the `.flow` file created or edited
2. **What was built** — summary of nodes added, edges wired, and logic implemented
3. **Validation status** — whether `flow validate` passes (or remaining errors if unresolvable)
4. **Mock placeholders** — list any `core.logic.mock` nodes that need to be replaced, and which skill to use
5. **Missing connections** — any connector nodes that need IS connections the user must create
6. **Next step** — ask if the user wants to debug the flow (do not run debug automatically)

# Flow Planning Guide

Reference for selecting nodes, wiring them correctly, and avoiding common mistakes when planning and building UiPath Flows.

## Node Catalog

### Triggers

| Node Type | Description | Output Ports |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `core.trigger.manual` | Entry point for manual workflow execution. Every flow needs at least one trigger. | `output` |

**Config:** No inputs needed. Must set `model.entryPointId` to a UUID matching `entry-points.json`.
**Constraint:** Must connect to at least one downstream node (`minConnections: 1`).

### Actions

#### Script (`core.action.script`)

Execute custom JavaScript code. Use for data transformation, computation, formatting, or any logic that doesn't need an external call.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | `success`, `error` |
| **Required inputs** | `script` (string, non-empty) |
| **Output variables** | `result` (the return value), `error` (error object if failed) |

**Script rules:**
- Must `return` an object: `return { key: value }` (not a bare scalar)
- Access upstream data via `$vars.nodeId.output` (see [Expressions](#expressions-and-variables))
- Example: `return { total: $vars.fetchData.output.items.length };`

#### HTTP Request (`core.action.http`)

Make REST API calls. Supports branching on response status, retries, and authentication via Integration Service connections.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | Dynamic branch ports (`branch-{id}`) + `default` + `error` |
| **Required inputs** | `method`, `url` |
| **Output variables** | `response` (`{ body, statusCode, headers }`), `error` |

**Key inputs:**
- `method` — GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE (default: GET)
- `url` — Must be a valid URL or expression
- `headers` — Object of key-value pairs
- `body` — Request body string (JSON, XML, etc.)
- `contentType` — default `application/json`
- `timeout` — ISO 8601 duration (default: `PT15M`)
- `retryCount` — Number of retries on failure (default: 0)
- `branches` — Array of `{ id, name, conditionExpression }` for response routing
- `authenticationType` — `manual` or from a connector connection
- `application`, `connection` — For IS-authenticated requests

**Dynamic ports:** Each entry in `branches` creates a `branch-{item.id}` output port. If no branch condition matches, flow goes to `default`. Error handling uses the `error` port.

#### Transform (`core.action.transform`)

Map, filter, or group-by data in a collection. Sub-variants: `core.action.transform.map`, `core.action.transform.filter`, `core.action.transform.group-by`.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | `success`, `error` |
| **Required inputs** | `collection` (non-empty), `operations` (non-empty array) |

### Control Flow

#### Decision (`core.logic.decision`)

If/else branching. Evaluates a boolean JavaScript expression and routes to `true` or `false` branch.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | `true`, `false` |
| **Required inputs** | `expression` (boolean JS expression) |

**Expression examples:**
- `$vars.fetchData.output.status === "approved"`
- `$vars.rollDice.output.roll > 3`
- `$vars.httpCall.response.statusCode === 200 && $vars.httpCall.response.body.count > 0`

Optional: `trueLabel` and `falseLabel` to customize branch display names.

#### Switch (`core.logic.switch`)

Multi-way branching. Evaluates cases in order, takes the first `true` one. Optional default fallback.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | Dynamic `case-{id}` ports + optional `default` |
| **Required inputs** | `cases` (array, min 1 item, each with `{ id, label, expression }`) |

**When to use Switch vs Decision:** Use Decision for simple true/false. Use Switch for 3+ branches (e.g., route by status code, priority level, category).

#### Loop (`core.logic.loop`)

Iterate over a collection. Supports sequential and parallel execution. Has aggregated output after all iterations complete.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input ports** | `input`, `loopBack` (internal loop return) |
| **Output ports** | `success` (after completion), `output` (aggregated results) |
| **Required inputs** | `collection` (expression pointing to array) |

**Internal variables (available inside loop body only):**
- `currentItem` — The item being processed in this iteration
- `currentIndex` — 0-based iteration index
- `collection` — The full collection

**External output:** `output` — Aggregated results from all iterations.

Optional: `parallel: true` to execute all iterations concurrently.

#### For Each (`core.logic.foreach`)

Simpler iteration — execute body once per item in a collection.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | `body` (executes per item), `completed` (after all items) |

**When to use Loop vs ForEach:** Use Loop when you need aggregated output or parallel execution. Use ForEach for simple sequential side-effects (send a notification per item, update a record per item).

#### While (`core.logic.while`)

Repeat while a condition is true. Condition evaluated before each iteration.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | `body` (while condition true), `exit` (when condition false) |

**When to use While:** Polling patterns (check until ready), retry loops with custom logic, processing until a condition changes.

#### Merge (`core.logic.merge`)

Synchronization point that waits for all incoming parallel paths to complete before continuing.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` (accepts multiple connections) |
| **Output port** | `output` |

**When to use:** After parallel branches (e.g., two API calls that can run simultaneously). Connect both branches to Merge, then continue from Merge's output.

#### End (`core.control.end`)

Graceful workflow completion. Use as the terminal node for each execution path.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | None |

**Output mapping:** If the workflow declares output variables, every End node must map all of them via `node.outputs[varId].source`.

#### Terminate (`core.logic.terminate`)

Immediately stop entire workflow execution (like throwing an exception). Use for fatal errors or abort conditions.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | None |

**End vs Terminate:** End = graceful completion of one path. Terminate = abort everything immediately. Use End for normal flow completion. Use Terminate for error paths where continuing other branches would be harmful.

### Placeholders

| Node Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `core.mock.blank` | Empty placeholder node (input → output). Use during planning to represent "TBD" steps. |
| `core.mock.node` | Mock node with error handling support. Use for prototyping. |

### Connector Nodes

Connector nodes are dynamically loaded from Integration Service and are not part of the OOTB registry. They appear after `uip login` + `uip flow registry pull`.

Connector nodes typically have:
- `category: "connector"`
- Complex `inputs` with `detail` object containing operation-specific fields
- `application` and `connection` fields for IS authentication
- Display labels from the connector's metadata

**To find connector nodes:**
```bash
uip flow registry search --filter "category=connector"
uip flow registry search slack --filter "category=connector"
```

**Before using a connector node:** Always discover its capabilities via IS commands (see Step 4 in SKILL.md). The registry tells you the node exists; IS tells you what it can do and what fields are required.

### Agent Nodes

Agent nodes invoke UiPath agents within a flow. Available after login.

```bash
uip flow registry search --filter "category=agent"
```

## Expressions and Variables

### The `$vars` System

Nodes communicate data through the `$vars` variable system. Every node's output is accessible to downstream nodes via `$vars.{nodeId}.{outputProperty}`.

**Common patterns:**
```javascript
// Access a script node's return value
$vars.rollDice.output.roll

// Access HTTP response body
$vars.fetchData.response.body

// Access HTTP status code
$vars.fetchData.response.statusCode

// Access HTTP response headers
$vars.fetchData.response.headers

// Access error information
$vars.someNode.error.message

// Access loop iteration context (inside loop body only)
$vars.myLoop.currentItem
$vars.myLoop.currentIndex
```

### Expression Syntax

Expressions are JavaScript-like and used in:
- Script node `script` field (full JS with `return`)
- Decision `expression` field (boolean expression)
- Switch case `expression` fields (boolean expressions)
- HTTP branch `conditionExpression` fields (boolean expressions)
- Any input field that accepts dynamic values

**Expression prefixes:**
- `=` prefix indicates a runtime expression: `=result.response` in output definitions
- `=js:` prefix in condition expressions (stripped before evaluation)

**Template interpolation:** Use `{{ expression }}` within string fields:
```
"Hello {{ $vars.getName.output.firstName }}"
```

### Workflow Variables

Declared in the `variables` section of the .flow file:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "globals": [
      {
        "id": "inputParam",
        "direction": "in",
        "type": "string",
        "defaultValue": "hello"
      },
      {
        "id": "outputResult",
        "direction": "out",
        "type": "object"
      }
    ],
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "rollResult",
        "type": "number",
        "binding": {
          "nodeId": "rollDice",
          "outputId": "result"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **`direction: "in"`** — Flow input parameter, accessible as `$vars.inputParam`
- **`direction: "out"`** — Flow output, must be mapped in every End node
- **`direction: "inout"`** — Both input and output
- **Node variables** — Bind to a specific node's output for use in `$vars`

---

## Node Selection Guide

### "I need to run custom logic"
Use **Script** (`core.action.script`). Write JavaScript, return an object.

### "I need to call an external API"
- **First choice:** Check if a **connector node** exists for the service (`uip flow registry search slack --filter "category=connector"`). Connectors handle auth, pagination, and error formatting automatically.
- **Second choice:** Use **HTTP Request** (`core.action.http`) for generic REST APIs or services without a dedicated connector.

### "I need to branch based on a condition"
- **Two paths:** Use **Decision** (`core.logic.decision`)
- **Three or more paths:** Use **Switch** (`core.logic.switch`)
- **Branch on HTTP response:** Use HTTP Request's built-in `branches` config (creates dynamic output ports per condition)

### "I need to iterate over a collection"
- **Simple side-effects per item:** Use **ForEach** (`core.logic.foreach`)
- **Need aggregated output or parallel execution:** Use **Loop** (`core.logic.loop`)
- **Repeat until a condition changes:** Use **While** (`core.logic.while`)

### "I need to run things in parallel"
Wire multiple outputs from one node to different downstream nodes. Use **Merge** (`core.logic.merge`) to synchronize before continuing.

### "I need to end the flow"
- **Normal completion:** Use **End** (`core.control.end`)
- **Abort on error:** Use **Terminate** (`core.logic.terminate`)
- A flow can have multiple End nodes (one per terminal path)

### "I need error handling"
Nodes with an `error` output port (Script, HTTP, Loop, Mock) can route errors to a handler. Wire the `error` port to a Script node that logs/formats the error, then to Terminate or a recovery path.

---

## Wiring Rules

### Port Compatibility

- Edges connect a **source** port (output) on one node to a **target** port (input) on another
- Source handles have `type: "source"`, target handles have `type: "target"`
- You cannot wire two source ports together or two target ports together

### Connection Constraints

Some nodes enforce connection rules via `constraints` in their handle configuration:

| Constraint | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `minConnections: N` | Handle must have at least N edges (validation error if not met) |
| `maxConnections: N` | Handle accepts at most N edges |
| `forbiddenSourceCategories: ["trigger"]` | Cannot receive connections from trigger nodes |
| `forbiddenTargetCategories: ["trigger"]` | Cannot connect output to trigger nodes |

**Key rules:**
- Trigger nodes can only have outgoing connections (no input port)
- End/Terminate nodes can only have incoming connections (no output port)
- Control flow outputs generally cannot loop back to triggers
- Decision and Switch nodes cannot receive connections from agent resource nodes

### Dynamic Ports

Some nodes create ports based on their configuration:
- **HTTP Request** — One port per `branches` entry: `branch-{id}`
- **Switch** — One port per `cases` entry: `case-{id}`
- **Loop** — `output` port for iteration body, `success` for completion

When wiring to dynamic ports, the port ID must match the configured item's `id`.

---

## Validation Rules

The `uip flow validate` command checks these rules. Knowing them helps avoid errors during planning.

### 1. TRIGGER_REQUIRED
Every flow must have at least one trigger node (node type starting with `core.trigger`).

### 2. MIN_CONNECTIONS
Handles with `minConnections` constraint must have enough edges. The manual trigger requires at least 1 outgoing connection.

### 3. SCHEMA_VALIDATION
Node inputs are validated against the node type's `inputDefinition` JSON Schema:
- Required fields must be present (e.g., Script's `script`, HTTP's `method` and `url`)
- String fields with `minLength: 1` cannot be empty
- **Expression bypass:** Values starting with `=` or containing `{{` skip type/format validation (can't validate runtime values)

### 4. CONDITION_EXPRESSION
JavaScript condition expressions are syntax-checked (parsed, not executed):
- Decision: `inputs.expression`
- Switch: each `inputs.cases[].expression`
- HTTP: each `inputs.branches[].conditionExpression`

### 5. OUTPUT_MAPPING
If the workflow declares output variables (`direction: "out"` or `"inout"`), every End node must have mappings for all of them in `node.outputs`.

### 6. DATA_TRANSFORM
Transform nodes must have valid operation configurations:
- `collection` must be non-empty
- `operations` array must not be empty
- Filter operations need conditions with non-empty `field`
- Map operations need mappings with non-empty `field` (if not keeping originals)
- Group-by needs non-empty `groupByField`

### What Validation Does NOT Check (Yet)

- Whether `$vars.nodeId.output` references actually point to real nodes
- Whether data types are compatible between connected nodes
- Whether expressions produce the expected type (e.g., boolean for Decision)
- Whether connector inputs have all required fields from the IS schema
- Whether connections referenced in connector nodes actually exist

These semantic checks are planned but not yet implemented. During planning, verify these manually.

## Common Flow Patterns

### Linear Pipeline
```
Trigger → Action A → Action B → Action C → End
```
Simple sequential processing. Each node's success port connects to the next node's input.

### Conditional Branch
```
Trigger → Fetch Data → Decision ──true──→ Process → End
                          │
                          └──false──→ Log Skip → End
```
Branch on a condition. Each path needs its own End node (or both can merge to one).

### Parallel Processing with Merge
```
                    ┌→ Call API A ─┐
Trigger → Split ────┤              ├→ Merge → Combine Results → End
                    └→ Call API B ─┘
```
Wire one node's output to multiple downstream nodes. Use Merge to wait for all before continuing.

### Error Handling
```
Trigger → HTTP Request ──success──→ Process → End
               │
               └──error──→ Log Error → Terminate
```
Use the `error` output port to catch failures. Route to a handler, then Terminate or retry.

### Loop with Aggregation
```
Trigger → Get Items → Loop(collection=$vars.getItems.output.items) ──body──→ Process Item
                         │                                                        │
                         │                                          (loopBack) ←──┘
                         └──success──→ Use Aggregated Output → End
```
Loop over a collection. Body executes per item. After all iterations, `success` port fires with aggregated output.

### Polling with While
```
Trigger → While(condition) ──body──→ Check Status → [feeds back]
                │
                └──exit──→ Status Ready → Process → End
```
Repeat until a condition changes. Useful for waiting on async operations.

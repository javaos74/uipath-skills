# Flow Planning Guide

Reference for selecting nodes, wiring them correctly, and avoiding common mistakes when planning and building UiPath Flows.

## Product Heuristics

These are org-wide "when to use what" rules that can't be encoded in individual node descriptions. They reflect how UiPath's products fit together and which approach to prefer for a given task.

### Connecting to External Services

Use this decision order — prefer higher tiers:

1. **Pre-built Integration Service connector** — Use when a connector exists and its activities cover your use case. Connectors handle auth (OAuth, API keys), token refresh, pagination, and error formatting automatically. Always check first: `uip flow registry search <service> --filter "category=connector"`.
2. **HTTP Request within a connector** — Use when a connector exists but lacks the specific API endpoint you need. The connector still manages authentication; you just supply the path and payload.
3. **Standalone HTTP Request node** (`core.action.http`) — Use for one-off API calls to services without connectors, or during prototyping when you need quick iteration. You handle auth manually (headers, tokens).
4. **RPA workflow node** — Use only when the target system has no API at all (legacy desktop apps, terminal-based systems, browser flows that can't be done via API). RPA requires robot infrastructure and is orders of magnitude slower than API-based approaches.

### Agent Nodes vs Workflow Logic

| Use an Agent node when... | Use Script/Decision/Switch when... |
|---|---|
| Input is ambiguous or unstructured (free text, emails, support tickets) | Input is structured and well-defined (JSON, form data) |
| The task requires reasoning or judgment (triage, classification, summarization) | The task is deterministic (if X then Y, map/filter/transform) |
| Branching depends on context that can't be reduced to simple conditions | Branching conditions are explicit and enumerable |
| You need natural language generation (draft emails, summaries) | You need data transformation or computation |

**Anti-pattern:** Don't use an agent node for tasks that can be done with a Decision + Script. Agents are slower, more expensive (LLM tokens), and less predictable. Use them where their flexibility is actually needed.

**Hybrid pattern:** Use workflow nodes for the deterministic parts (fetch data, transform, route) and agent nodes for the ambiguous parts (classify intent, draft response, extract entities). The flow orchestrates; the agent reasons.

## Node Catalog

### Triggers

| Node Type | Description | Output Ports |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `core.trigger.manual` | Entry point for manual workflow execution. Every flow needs at least one trigger. | `output` |

**Config:** No inputs needed. Must set `model.entryPointId` to a UUID matching `entry-points.json`.
**Constraint:** Must connect to at least one downstream node (`minConnections: 1`).

### Actions

#### Script (`core.action.script`)

Execute custom JavaScript code. Use for data transformation, computation, formatting, or any logic that doesn't need an external call.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | `success` |
| **Required inputs** | `script` (string, non-empty) |
| **Output variables** | `output` (the return value), `error` (error object if failed) |

**Script rules:**
- JavaScript only (not TypeScript, not Python)
- Must `return` an object: `return { key: value }` (not a bare scalar)
- `$vars` is available as a global — use it directly: `return { upper: $vars.input1.toUpperCase() }`
- Cannot make HTTP calls or access external systems (use HTTP node for that)
- 30-second execution timeout
- Limits: ~10k characters inbound script, ~1MB outbound payload

#### HTTP Request (`core.action.http`)

Make REST API calls. Supports branching on response status, retries, and authentication via Integration Service connections.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | Dynamic branch ports (`branch-{id}`) + `default` |
| **Required inputs** | `method`, `url` |
| **Output variables** | `output` (`{ body, statusCode, headers }`), `error` |

**Key inputs:**
- `method` — GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE (default: GET)
- `url` — Must be a valid URL or expression
- `headers` — Object of key-value pairs
- `body` — Request body string (JSON, XML, etc.)
- `contentType` — default `application/json`
- `timeout` — ISO 8601 duration (default: `PT15M`)
- `retryCount` — Number of retries on failure (default: 0)
- `branches` — Array of `{ id, name, conditionExpression }` for response routing
- `authenticationType` — `manual` or from a connector connection
- `application`, `connection` — For IS-authenticated requests

**Dynamic ports:** Each entry in `branches` creates a `branch-{item.id}` output port. If no branch condition matches, flow goes to `default`.

#### Transform (`core.action.transform`)

Map, filter, or group-by data in a collection. Sub-variants: `core.action.transform.map`, `core.action.transform.filter`, `core.action.transform.group-by`.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | `output` |
| **Required inputs** | `collection` (non-empty), `operations` (non-empty array) |

### Control Flow

#### Decision (`core.logic.decision`)

If/else branching. Evaluates a boolean JavaScript expression and routes to `true` or `false` branch.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | `true`, `false` |
| **Required inputs** | `expression` (boolean JS expression) |

**Expression examples:**
- `$vars.fetchData.output.status === "approved"`
- `$vars.rollDice.output.roll > 3`
- `$vars.httpCall.output.statusCode === 200 && $vars.httpCall.output.body.count > 0`

Optional: `trueLabel` and `falseLabel` to customize branch display names.

#### Switch (`core.logic.switch`)

Multi-way branching. Evaluates cases in order, takes the first `true` one. Optional default fallback.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | Dynamic `case-{id}` ports + optional `default` |
| **Required inputs** | `cases` (array, min 1 item, each with `{ id, label, expression }`) |

**When to use Switch vs Decision:** Use Decision for simple true/false. Use Switch for 3+ branches (e.g., route by status code, priority level, category).

#### Loop (`core.logic.loop`)

Iterate over a collection. Supports sequential and parallel execution. Has aggregated output after all iterations complete.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input ports** | `input`, `loopBack` (internal loop return) |
| **Output ports** | `success` (after completion), `output` (aggregated results) |
| **Required inputs** | `collection` (expression pointing to array) |

**Internal variables (available inside loop body only):**
- `currentItem` — The item being processed in this iteration
- `currentIndex` — 0-based iteration index
- `collection` — The full collection

**External output:** `output` — Aggregated results from all iterations.

Optional: `parallel: true` to execute all iterations concurrently.

#### Merge (`core.logic.merge`)

Synchronization point that waits for all incoming parallel paths to complete before continuing.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` (accepts multiple connections) |
| **Output port** | `output` |

**When to use:** After parallel branches (e.g., two API calls that can run simultaneously). Connect both branches to Merge, then continue from Merge's output.

#### End (`core.control.end`)

Graceful workflow completion. Use as the terminal node for each execution path.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | None |

**Output mapping:** If the workflow declares output variables, every End node must map all of them via `node.outputs[varId].source`.

#### Terminate (`core.logic.terminate`)

Immediately stop entire workflow execution (like throwing an exception). Use for fatal errors or abort conditions.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Input port** | `input` |
| **Output ports** | None |

**End vs Terminate:** End = graceful completion of one path. Terminate = abort everything immediately. Use End for normal flow completion. Use Terminate for error paths where continuing other branches would be harmful.

### Placeholders

| Node Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `core.logic.mock` | Placeholder node (input → output). Use during planning to represent "TBD" steps or for prototyping. |

### Connector Nodes

Connector nodes are dynamically loaded from Integration Service and are not part of the OOTB registry. They appear after `uip login` + `uip flow registry pull`.

Connector nodes typically have:
- `category: "connector"`
- Complex `inputs` with `detail` object containing operation-specific fields
- `application` and `connection` fields for IS authentication
- Display labels from the connector's metadata

**To find connector nodes:**
```bash
uip flow registry search --filter "category=connector"
uip flow registry search slack --filter "category=connector"
```

**Before using a connector node:** Always discover its capabilities via IS commands (see Step 4 in SKILL.md). The registry tells you the node exists; IS tells you what it can do and what fields are required.

### Agent Nodes

Agent nodes invoke UiPath agents within a flow. Available after login.

```bash
uip flow registry search --filter "category=agent"
```

## Expressions and Variables

### The `$vars` System

Nodes communicate data through the `$vars` variable system. Every node's output is accessible to downstream nodes via `$vars.{nodeId}.{outputProperty}`.

**Common patterns:**
```javascript
// Access a script node's return value
$vars.rollDice.output.roll

// Access HTTP response body
$vars.fetchData.output.body

// Access HTTP status code
$vars.fetchData.output.statusCode

// Access HTTP response headers
$vars.fetchData.output.headers

// Access error information
$vars.someNode.error.message

// Access loop iteration context (inside loop body only)
$vars.myLoop.currentItem
$vars.myLoop.currentIndex
```

### Expression Syntax

Expressions are JavaScript-like and used in:
- Script node `script` field (full JS with `return`)
- Decision `expression` field (boolean expression)
- Switch case `expression` fields (boolean expressions)
- HTTP branch `conditionExpression` fields (boolean expressions)
- Any input field that accepts dynamic values

**Expression prefixes:**
- `=` prefix indicates a runtime expression: `=result.response` in output definitions
- `=js:` prefix in condition expressions (stripped before evaluation)

**Template interpolation:** Use `{{ expression }}` within string fields:
```
"Hello {{ $vars.getName.output.firstName }}"
```

## Node Selection Guide

### "I need to run custom logic"
Use **Script** (`core.action.script`). Write JavaScript, return an object. Common pattern: HTTP (fetch) → Script (transform) → HTTP (send) or Decision (branch).

### "I need to call an external API"
- **First choice:** Check if a **connector node** exists for the service (`uip flow registry search slack --filter "category=connector"`). Connectors handle auth, pagination, and error formatting automatically.
- **Second choice:** Use **HTTP Request** (`core.action.http`) for generic REST APIs or services without a dedicated connector.

### "I need to branch based on a condition"
- **Two paths:** Use **Decision** (`core.logic.decision`)
- **Three or more paths:** Use **Switch** (`core.logic.switch`)
- **Branch on HTTP response:** Use HTTP Request's built-in `branches` config (creates dynamic output ports per condition)

### "I need to transform data"
- **Standard map/filter/group-by on collections:** Use **Transform** (`core.action.transform`) — declarative, no code needed.
- **Custom logic:** Use **Script** (`core.action.script`).

### "I need to iterate over a collection"
Use **Loop** (`core.logic.loop`). Supports both sequential and parallel execution, with aggregated output after all iterations complete.

### "I need to run things in parallel"
Wire multiple outputs from one node to different downstream nodes. Use **Merge** (`core.logic.merge`) to synchronize before continuing.

### "I need to end the flow"
- **Normal completion:** Use **End** (`core.control.end`)
- **Abort on error:** Use **Terminate** (`core.logic.terminate`)
- A flow can have multiple End nodes (one per terminal path)

### "I need error handling"
Nodes expose error information via `$vars.nodeId.error` (with `code`, `message`, `detail` fields). Use a Decision node after an action to check for errors and branch to a handler or Terminate.

### "The flow needs something I can't build with flow nodes"
When a flow requires capabilities outside the flow skill's scope — an RPA process for desktop automation, a coded workflow for complex logic, a custom agent — **stop and point, don't chain skills.**

1. Add a `core.logic.mock` placeholder node in the plan where the external component goes
2. Tell the user what's needed and which skill to use:
   - Desktop/browser automation → `/uipath:uipath-rpa-workflows`
   - Coded workflow (C#) → `/uipath:uipath-coded-workflows`
   - Agent → `/uipath:uipath-coded-agents`
3. Once the user creates the component, replace the placeholder with the real node

**Do not** attempt to invoke other skills automatically. Each skill should work independently — cross-skill chaining multiplies failure rates.

## Wiring Rules

### Port Compatibility

- Edges connect a **source** port (output) on one node to a **target** port (input) on another
- Source handles have `type: "source"`, target handles have `type: "target"`
- You cannot wire two source ports together or two target ports together

### Connection Constraints

Some nodes enforce connection rules via `constraints` in their handle configuration:

| Constraint | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `minConnections: N` | Handle must have at least N edges (validation error if not met) |
| `maxConnections: N` | Handle accepts at most N edges |
| `forbiddenSourceCategories: ["trigger"]` | Cannot receive connections from trigger nodes |
| `forbiddenTargetCategories: ["trigger"]` | Cannot connect output to trigger nodes |

**Key rules:**
- Trigger nodes can only have outgoing connections (no input port)
- End/Terminate nodes can only have incoming connections (no output port)
- Control flow outputs generally cannot loop back to triggers
- Decision and Switch nodes cannot receive connections from agent resource nodes

### Dynamic Ports

Some nodes create ports based on their configuration:
- **HTTP Request** — One port per `branches` entry: `branch-{id}`
- **Switch** — One port per `cases` entry: `case-{id}`
- **Loop** — `success` port fires after completion, `output` port carries aggregated results

When wiring to dynamic ports, the port ID must match the configured item's `id`.

## Common Flow Patterns

### Linear Pipeline
```
Trigger → Action A → Action B → Action C → End
```
Simple sequential processing. Each node's output port (`success` for Script, `default` for HTTP, `output` for Transform) connects to the next node's `input`.

### Conditional Branch
```
Trigger → Fetch Data → Decision ──true──→ Process → End
                          │
                          └──false──→ Log Skip → End
```
Branch on a condition. Each path needs its own End node (or both can merge to one).

### Parallel Processing with Merge
```
                    ┌→ Call API A ─┐
Trigger → Split ────┤              ├→ Merge → Combine Results → End
                    └→ Call API B ─┘
```
Wire one node's output to multiple downstream nodes. Use Merge to wait for all before continuing.

### Error Handling
```
Trigger → HTTP Request ──default──→ Decision($vars.httpCall.error) ──true──→ Log Error → Terminate
                                        │
                                        └──false──→ Process → End
```
Check `$vars.nodeId.error` after action nodes. Use a Decision to branch on error presence, then route to a handler or Terminate.

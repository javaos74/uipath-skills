# Claude Plugin Marketplace

This repository contains a Claude Code plugin marketplace with configuration and management files.

## Managing Marketplaces

### Adding a Marketplace

To add a marketplace, use the `claude plugin marketplace add` command:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./
```

This adds the current directory as a marketplace, making all plugins in it available for installation.

### Removing a Marketplace

To remove a marketplace, use the `claude plugin marketplace remove` command:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace remove uipath-marketplace
```

Replace `uipath-marketplace` with the name of the marketplace you want to remove.

## Managing Plugins

### Installing a Plugin

To install a plugin from a marketplace, use the `claude plugin install` command:

```bash
claude plugin install <plugin-name>@uipath-marketplace
```

Example:
```bash
claude plugin install uipath-coded-agents@uipath-marketplace
```

### Uninstalling a Plugin

To uninstall a plugin, use the `claude plugin uninstall` command:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall <plugin-name>

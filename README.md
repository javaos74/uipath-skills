# UiPath Agent Skills

> [!NOTE]
> **Work in Progress** — This repository is under active development. Skills are being added and refined. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome! See [Contributing](#contributing) below.

UiPath Agent Skills give AI coding agents the domain knowledge to build, run, test, and deploy UiPath automations and agents — directly from your development environment. Each skill is a self-contained package of instructions and resources that teaches your coding agent how to perform a specific UiPath task.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx skills add uipath/skills
```

Select the skills you need from the wizard. Skills are installed into your coding agent's directory and ready to use.

## Skill Catalog

### Automation & Platform (`uipath`)

Skills for building and managing UiPath automation projects — coded workflows in C#, RPA workflows in XAML, Flow projects in JSON, desktop/browser UI automation, and platform operations.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **uipath-coded-workflows** | Create, edit, build, and run UiPath coded automations (.cs) with activity references for 20+ packages |
| **uipath-rpa-workflows** | Generate and edit RPA workflows (XAML) in UiPath Studio Desktop with discovery-first approach |
| **uipath-flow** | Create, validate, and debug UiPath Flow projects using the `.flow` JSON format and `uip` CLI |
| **uipath-development** | Authentication, Orchestrator management, solution lifecycle, Integration Service, and CLI tools |
| **uipath-servo** | Desktop and browser UI automation and testing — click, type, read, verify, screenshot, and extract UI elements |

### Coded Agents (`uipath-coded-agents`)

Skills for the full lifecycle of UiPath Python coded agents — from project scaffolding to evaluation and deployment. Supports LangGraph, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents SDK, and simple function agents.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **auth** | Authenticate with UiPath Cloud or on-premise (OAuth, client credentials, tenant selection) |
| **setup** | Scaffold and initialize agent projects with `uipath new`, `uv sync`, and `uipath init` |
| **build** | Implement agent logic with framework-specific patterns (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents, simple functions) |
| **run** | Run agents locally or invoke published agents in UiPath Cloud |
| **evaluate** | Create and run evaluations with built-in evaluators (ExactMatch, LLMJudge, Trajectory, and more) |
| **deploy** | Package and publish agents to Orchestrator |
| **sync** | Push and pull project files to and from Studio Web |
| **bindings** | Synchronize agent code with `bindings.json` for UiPath platform resource overrides |
| **uipath** | Full lifecycle orchestrator — runs auth, setup, build, run, evaluate, deploy, and sync end-to-end |

## Claude Code

This repository also works as a **Claude Code plugin**. If you use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), you can install skills as a plugin marketplace for direct access to slash commands.

### Add the marketplace

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/UiPath/skills
```

### Install a plugin

```bash
# Install the automation & platform plugin
claude plugin install uipath@uipath-marketplace

# Install the coded agents plugin
claude plugin install uipath-coded-agents@uipath-marketplace
```
